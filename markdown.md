### P1
Full sharing among coders means the exchange of source code, which enables others to see the instructions behind the software and improve upon that. Avid hackers, like Stallman, are willing to work in a community where source codes can be freely shared (including some even more private information like emails), but companies do not want to do so. They want the software they develop to be lucrative and thus have to keep the source codes secret so that their competitors can not develop a similar or better version of the software or the games. 

### P2
**Stallman’s four freedom**
1.	The users can execute the program in whatever way they want and for whatever purpose. 
2.	Users can freely access the source code and make modifications to it according to their own will. 
3.	Users can make copies of the source code and give or sell that to others if they want to. 
4.	Users can also make copies and freely give or sell the modified versions of the code that they make. 

I think one of the software that I use frequently, LaTex, adheres to all these four. I can see the source code that corresponds to the text after compilation. I can freely access it and use different templates and modifications when writing different types of essays. I can also freely share the LaTex project with others, including the ones that I have modified. 

### P3

"Transparent walls" means that people think they are given freedom, like they can change the configurations and utilize all of the functions freely on the electronic devices as they want to. However, it is actually "a prison" because of the restrictions users face. A lot of limitations exist and the information of the users are not well guarded as they believe. When I use wechat, I also have the feeling that it is a prison with transparent walls. It seems like I can express my thoughts freely in my posts and can talk about whatever topic I like with my friends, the contents I post are actually strictly regulated by the company. Sometimes, when people post politically sensitive contents, the articles would be automatically deleted. Also, wechat sport can specifically track where anyone has been to throughout the day, which signifies a lack of authentic freedom. 

### P4
A lot of software is proprietary because of the developers and the coampnies’ consideration of profits. They want to keep the source codes industrial secrets and thus do not allow others to copy their work with ease so that they could better monopolize the industry or at least in a certain aspect. Surely, proprietary software has certain advantages. The software is very likely to be stable and reliable as the creators tested numerous times beforehand and could guarantee that everything could be run perfectly. Also, proprietary software is unique, and you could only find it with that provider. 

### P5
Stallman resigned from MIT after making controversial comments on rape. While the girl in the case was 17 years old and should be considered illegal for sex in that place, Stallman did not define the case as rape. Although Stallman has his own defenses, he was accused of being misleading and unethical because of his remarks. This is actually not very surprising, as Stallman has always been stubborn and one that does not easily conform to the perspectives of others. Nevertheless, people should not use there accusations towards Stallman’s personality to attack his accomplishments in the coding world. Even though there might be certain defects in his personality, his contributions are still undeniable, and it is wrongful for people to use character assassination.
